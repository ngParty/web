      We need to deal with complexity all the time, from the daily functions and UI components that we write, to the big architectural decisions we have to make from time to time.
      In this walk we'll explore complexity from different angles, debate how we can manage it, but also how to appreciate it more.`,

      We'll see how applications for the browser are written with typical idioms and features from Kotlin, what interaction looks like between JavaScript and Kotlin, and what libraries are available from the Kotlin ecosystem that make working with web technologies a breeze – from concurrent applications with coroutines to painless and typesafe communication.`,

It has been around for several years and had enough time to evolve, coordinate, and iterate on many different aspects of the platform, may it be the syntax, the JS compiler, the community libraries, documentation or even legal organization.

      Other programming language communities might have been observing the language carefully from the distance, but probably never had a real motivation of trying it out. This talk will give some insights on the language, the ecosystem, distinct features and will also highlight some recent accomplishments and milestones within the Reason community.

      In the end attendees will understand why Reason users are excited about the language and what sets it apart from other similar looking ecosystems and may be even interested in trying it out themselves.`,
